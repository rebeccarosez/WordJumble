# WordJumble
WordJumble is a program that takes a string as input and outputs all valid english words that can be made with the letters in that string, in any combination. The dictionary it compares the words to is word_list.40. This program uses binary search so it assumes that the words in word_list.40 are in alphabetical order according to ASCII standards (A, B, C, a, b, c).

To run script, run ./WordJumble in the directory

When run, script will continually prompt the user for words as input and will output all of the words that can be made out of their letters until the user enters "q" to quit.
